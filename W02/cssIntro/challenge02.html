  <h1>CSS - Cascading Stylesheets</h1>


  <h2>CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.</h2>

  <div class="first-paragraph">
    <p>
      CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation
      of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such
      as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on
      screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. There are many variations
      of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
      alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't
      look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
      you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
      All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks
      as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
      dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
      to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore
      always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
